# pEt-Commerce
 Abstract:
 Online shop for pet accessories
 I wanted to make an E-Commerce website to practice my coding skills.
 In this project I made use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Strapi and Stripe

 Additional features added overtime:
 - Added filter tabs
 - Added image carousel
 - Added page linked to image carousel
 - Added related products
 - Added filter slider
 
 Issues encountered along the way:
 - One image broke the website because the dimensions were too small
 - Struggling to deploy the website with Strapi database
